  How to combine high performance of GPU or CPU parallelization with python programing convenience and flexibility and apply them to computational physics? 
  The answer is BOA.
  BOA is python module for computation physics. The Python hood covers engine providing OpenCL realization of numerous numerical techniques for solution of partial
  differential equations. The techniques mainly targeted to solve partial differential equations for physical processes.
