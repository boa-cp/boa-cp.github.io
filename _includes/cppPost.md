# Computational Physics Platform

  How to combine high performance of GPU or CPU parallelization with [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} programming convenience and flexibility and apply them to computational physics? 
  The answer is BOA.

  BOA is python module for [Computation physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics#:~:text=Computational%20physics%20is%20the%20study,a%20subset%20of%20computational%20science.){:target="_blank"}. 
  The Python hood covers engine providing [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/){:target="_blank"} 
  realization of numerous numerical techniques for solution of partial
  differential equations. The techniques mainly targeted to solve partial differential equations for physical processes.
