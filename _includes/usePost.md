# BOA in production pipeline

A central concept of BOA is to combine usability with high performance. 
Under the term "usability" we mean that people with mathematical, physical, or image-processing backgrounds can use it. The BOA module can be used in "immediate mode" as well as in script mode. "Immediate mode" allows fast and flexible development of a numerical algorithm. The commands used during the development stage can be combined into a script. Python allows a combination of the use of scripts and immediate mode together. 

The resulted script will have high performance 

This combination allows making a seamless transition from R&D to production.
