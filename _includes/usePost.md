# BOA in production pipeline

Central concept of BOA is to combine usability with high performance. 
Under the term "usability" we mean that people with mathematical, physical or 
image-processing background can use it. The BOA module can be uses in 
"immediate mode" as well as in script mode. "Immediate mode" allows fast and 
flexible development of a numerical algorithm. The commands used during the 
development stage can be combined into script. Python allows combination 
of use of scripts and immediate mode together. 

The resulted script will have high performance 

This combination allows to make seamless transition from R&D to production.
