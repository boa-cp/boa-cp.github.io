![Services](/pics/drawingS.png)

We provide full range of services in field of numerical algorithms. Starting
from algorithm formulation and ending with it's implementation and support.



## Algorithm formulation

We provide service of development, formulation and implementation of numerical algorithms. 
Rich experience in scientific topics: _Physics_, _Chemistry_,  _Electrochemistry_ ,_Engineering_, _Thermodynamics_, _Thermal analysis_.
Additionally: __Image procesing__, __Signal processing__ and __Geometrical modeling__ algorithms.

## Mathematical implementation and adaptation 

Mathematical algorithm formulation should be done with __implementation in mind__. 


## Algorithm implementation: coding, profiling and support 

We had successful projects in fields:
- Multi-physics
- Partial differential equations 
- Signal processing algorithms
- Algorithms implementation C++, Python, OpenCL, Embedded
