![Service](/pics/drawingS.png)

We provide a full range of services in the field of __numerical algorithms__. Starting
from __algorithm formulation__ and ending with it's __implementation and support__. 
We have rich experience in different fields of science, image- and signal- processing
and geometrical modeling. Our solutions based on integration and implementation of 
publicly known and __proprietary__ algorithms in an efficient way.

The algorithm development project has three main phases: __"Formulation"__, 
__"Mathematical implementation"__ and __"Implementation"__. Typically each phase is done by 
a separate group with different expertise. Therefore a lot of time is required for
inter-group communications and this process can take several cycles. BOA succeeded in concentrating 
expertise in these three phases in one group. This __reduces__ significantly development 
__time__ and __costs__.

## Algorithm formulation

We provide service of development, formulation and implementation of numerical algorithms. 
Rich experience in scientific topics: _Physics_, _Chemistry_,  _Electrochemistry_ ,_Engineering_, _Thermodynamics_, _Thermal analysis_.
Additionally: __Image processing__, __Signal processing__ and __Geometrical modeling__ algorithms.

Choosing algorithm techniques and components we are preferring those allowing __parallel implementation__. 
This property is important for __optimal utilization of modern computation hardware__. 

## Mathematical implementation and adaptation 

This phase requires deep understanding of details of an algorithm on the one hand 
and knowledge of implementation related issues on the other hand. In our projects we are choosing
mathematical approaches allowing to reach low memory footprint and high execution performance.
Among other techniques we use virtual matrix technique for iterative methods. 
Our philosophy is that _"Mathematical algorithms should be formulated with __implementation in mind__"_.

## Algorithm implementation: coding, profiling and support 

We had successful projects implemented in: C, C++, Python and OpenCL. 
Implementations were targeted to regular executives of embedded.
