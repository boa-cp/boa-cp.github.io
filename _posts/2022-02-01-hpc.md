High-performance computing (HPC) is a large field of computing. 
It includes specific algorithm techniques and hardware resources. 
All these are focused on achieving a minimal time consumption for complex calculations for a minimal time.

We have vast experience in HPC algorithm development. 

## Hardware paradigms

Modern computing hardware is available in different paradigms:

+ Multi-core/Multi-processor
+ Cluster
+ GPU
+ GPU Cluster

Each item requires fine-tuning of algorithmic approach for getting the best efficiency.
We are providing hardware-specific algorithm analysis and optimization services.
