![BOA Python module](/pics/drawingPB2.png) 

__BOA__ python module is a __comprehensive tool for R&D and production.__ 
We provide service developing a dedicated high-performance python module for your computation problems.
The python module approach allows combining __high usability__ during computation algorithm development with __production worthy performance__. The underlying computation engine uses 
[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/){:target="_blank"} technique allowing efficient utilization of all available computational resources (e.g., CPU and GPU). 

Fields of application are: 
[Computation physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics#:~:text=Computational%20physics%20is%20the%20study,a%20subset%20of%20computational%20science.){:target="_blank"}, 
Image- and signal-processing. It can contain implementations of numerous numerical techniques for solving partial
differential equations and different data processing algorithms. All used algorithms allow them to combine into complex processing systems.
