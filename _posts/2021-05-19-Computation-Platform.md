![BOA Python module](/pics/drawingPB2.png) 

__BOA__ python module is a __comprehensive tool for R&D and production.__ 
The python module approach allows to combine __high usability__ during computation 
algorithm development with __production worthy performance__. The underlying computation engine is based on 
[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/){:target="_blank"} allowing efficient utilization of all available computational resources (e.g., CPU and GPU). 

BOA is targeted to  [Computation physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics#:~:text=Computational%20physics%20is%20the%20study,a%20subset%20of%20computational%20science.){:target="_blank"}. 
Image and signal processing. It contains realization of numerous numerical techniques for solution of partial
differential equations and different data processing algorithms. All algorithms implemented
in a manner allowing to combine them together into complex processing systems.
