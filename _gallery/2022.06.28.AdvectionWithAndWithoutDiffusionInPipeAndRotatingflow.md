title:  "Advection with and without diffusion in pipe- and rotating- flow"
date:   2022-07-24

short: These video demonstrates liquid species transport processes. The species are dragged by an alternating flow.  The two cases corresponds to the pure convective transport and to the convection-diffusion transport.

The solutions for pure convection cases are obtained analytically. 

### Miscible vs Immiscible Fluids in pipe flow 2D

The video demonstrates liquid species transport processes. The species 
are dragged by an alternating flow with a parabolic profile in both cases.  The top case corresponds to the pure 
convective transport, while the bottom one to the convection-diffusion transport.

### Miscible vs Immiscible Fluids in shear flow within a cylinder 2D

The video demonstrates species transport processes. 
In both examples, the species is dragged by an alternating flow. 
The flow profile corresponds to a cylinder with a rotating wall. 
The right picture corresponds to the pure convective transport while the left one to the convection-diffusion case.


## Mathematical background


\\[ \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = -\vec v \cdot \vec\nabla c\\]

\\[ \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D\Delta c + \vec v \cdot \vec\nabla c\\]
